# MonteCarlo-Molecular-Dynamics-simulation
This program uses a Python script to implement Monte Carlo methods to molecular modelling. An original configuration is constructed of disks A and B, and the simulation is run for a number of timesteps. By varying the density of the disks and the temperature of the simulation, the evolution of the molecule can be studied over a number of timesteps.
